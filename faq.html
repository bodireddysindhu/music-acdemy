  <summary>
Should I learn Hindustani or carnatic?
</summary>
<pre>
This is more of a personal choice. Each form 
of music is different from the other, and one 
can decide based on what sounds better to them.
We advise you to take up the music form that 
you like listening to as listening is one of 
the most important components of learning how 
to sing. 
To understand the difference between 
Hindustani and Carnatic forms of Indian 
Classical Music, watch this video where 
Shankar Mahadevan explains the key differences
between the two forms</pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
  Which course is preferred for me? I am a beginner and have no prior experience in learning music. 
</summary>
Our 101 course covers the basics of music - knowledge of swar, singing in taal (rhythm) and pitch (sur). If your interest area is Hindustani music - please enroll in our HV101 course. For Carnatic music, please enroll in CV101. If your child is inclined towards world music please select any of our Grow with Music courses based on his/her age.
</details><br>
<details>
  <summary>
    Do I have to start at the beginner level in a series if I have already studied music?
  </summary>
  Pre-requisites are needed to join any level other than 101. You can find the pre-requisite criteria in our web site. For new students wanting to join advanced courses an assessment will be done, by the Academy to see if there are ready for the course.
</details><br>
<details>
  <summary>
    Can two or more students use the same account for the class?
  </summary>
  As per our academic policies, an enrollment is only applicable to a single student. Each additional student needs to have a separate enrollment. 
</details><br>
<details>
  <summary>
    How do I pay for courses? Is payment secure?
  </summary>
  You can enroll and pay for courses online. We use Paypal(USD) and EBS(INR) for secure processing of payments, and accept most major credit cards. 
</details><br>
<details>
  <summary>
    What are the available timing slots (EST timings) for the classes?
  </summary>
  This is the best part of an online class - you pick a date and time when you wish to start your class and each week you will have a class scheduled on the same day and time. We will try and match a teacher who will be available to you based on the time slot you select.
</details><br>
<details>
  <summary>
    What are the learning materials available to me ?
  </summary>
  Every Academy student has access to the following learning materials:

OM Book™ - this will contain all the learning materials for the course you have enrolled in inlcuding video and audio lessons, lyrics, notations and theory
Class Recordings - students have the option to purchase the recordings of their class. This enables the student to recap what the teacher had taught in a previous class
Practice Recordings - Practice pages in an OM Book allow students can practice a compostion or a swara pattern and submit them for evaluation by their teachers
Assessments - Regular assessments help students solidify their knowledge of the concepts as well as the compositions being taught
</details><br>
<details>
  <summary>
    What are practice recordings?
  </summary>
  As music is perfected through practice, the Academy encourages students to spend some time every day practicing through the OM Book™. The OM Book™ has Practice Pages (marked in Red in your Table of Contents), which include the video/audio and lyrics/notations along with a recorder in the same page making it convenient for a student to listen practice and record their singing till they get it right.

As a student, you can record as many practice recordings as you need, however, the number of recordings you can submit for feedback is limited based on the course. 
For a 12 week course, the student may submit up to 6 recordings. For a 4 week course, the student may submit one recording. For self-study courses, the student may submit one recording per song.
</details><br>
<details>
  <summary>
    Do I get a Certificate after the completion of my course?
  </summary>
  Yes, our Hindustani Vocals, Carnatic Vocals and Voice Gym courses are Certification courses. You will be expected to submit regular assessments which will be graded by your teacher. At the end of your course, you will have a summative assessment and receive a report card and a certificate signed by Shankar Mahadevan.
</details><br>
<details>
  <summary>
    What if I don't want to submit assessments?
  </summary>
  For those of you who consider music to be a  hobby to indulge in rather than a skill you wish to gain mastery may opt for an Audit Course. An Audit Course will NOT require you to submit any assessments, rather, your teacher will evaluate your skills in the final class of your course and provide you with a summative assessment which will indicate your progress. 
You will  receive a Participation Certificate ONLY at the end of an Audit Course.
</details><br>
<details>
  <summary>
